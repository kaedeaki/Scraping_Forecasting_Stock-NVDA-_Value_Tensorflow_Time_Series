# **Scraping_Forecasting_Stock_Value_Tensorflow_Time_Series**  

**Name of project**: Scraping & Forecasting Stock Value with Tensorflow Time Series  
**Aim**: To forecast the stock price using Time Series with Tensorflow.  
**Language**: Python   
**Solution**: Analyze stock value by Tensorflow with Time Series, and scraping the dataset from the original source.  
**Results**: It predicted well if the volatility is the trend in the time range which is in the short term. However, in the long term, it cannot predict well since it cannot adapt to the fluctuation in the short term. Time series forecasting can be useful in forecasting sales, revenue, stock prices, other financial variables, disease outbreaks, patient admission rates, traffic patterns, shipping volumes, and delivery times.
